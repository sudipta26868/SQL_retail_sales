# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project 
**Project OverView**
**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis

Here, I have created this SQL project to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. 

**Objectives**
1) **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2) **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3) **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4) **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.
